# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher solution

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I did this project again later on. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Chamara-Wijepala/where-in-the-world)

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

- Live Site URL: [Live Demo](https://chamara-wijepala.github.io/react-rest-countries/)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### What I learned

- Using Styled Components to write CSS. It's much easier than writing all the CSS in one file, but I'm still getting used to it.

- useParams React hook. I used it to get the country code from the URL and use it to render the details of the right country.

- Lazy loading images in React with the React Lazy Load Image Component npm package. It's not possible to lazy load images the same way as it is in regular HTML.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about Styled Components and also learn more about react hooks.

I also feel like my file structure for this project is not efficient enough, so I want to learn more about project structuring.
